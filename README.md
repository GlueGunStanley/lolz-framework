# lolz-framework
A framework being designed for FiveM.

# Disclaimer
I have no clue if I'll end up finishing this framework, what it's going to be designed to do, etc. I know I get bored a lot when I have downtime and have wanted to make a framework for FiveM for a long time now just for fun. 

## What is this?
As I mentioned above, it's going to hopefully be a completed framework for FiveM at some time. What specifically will the framework do? Not sure yet. I know I'm not designing it around the roleplay aspect, I want to make something modular, that you can work with to turn it into whatever. So, it'll be more like a core that has a bunch of utilities. Oh, so I guess this is the "lolz-core."
